# RhAMPseq <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/villegar/RhAMPseq/master/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" align="right" height=200px/>
Analysis of rhAmpSeq data.

## Data description
**Author:** J.L.

### Files
- `r filename("hap_genotype")`: haplotype genotyping data for all samples. This is in a number code. 
The number code corresponds to a specific sequenced haplotype at each locus. 
- `r filename("HaplotypeAllele.fasta")`: each marker is a conserved region of the genome, so the haplotype allele may differ only by a single SNP, or it could be many SNPS or indels.  
- `r filename("readCountMatrixFile")`: number of read for each amplicon and each sample.  This data is also provided in the `r  filename("hap_genotype")` file.

### Example
```{r, echo = FALSE}
example <- data.frame(
  Locus	= "rh_chr1_10143990",
  Haplotypes = "2(0.37);4(0.16);9(0.10);5(0.09);1(0.07);3(0.07);8(0.05);13(0.04);6(0.03);7(0.03);",
  blank__vDNAfen551A01_A01 = "./.:0",
  `160_271_303__vDNAfen551A01_A02` = "4/2:34,24",
  `160_271_311__vDNAfen551A01_A03` = "2/2:71"
)

# `%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
knitr::kable(example)
```

where:

- `Locus` is the marker.  

- `Haplotypes` lists the frequency of haplotypes at this `Locus` in the _ENTIRE_ dataset, not just our samples. You can mostly ignore this.

- Next column starts with `blank`, this is a blank control well in the plate. Here at this `Locus` it sequenced as `./.`, which means `NULL`.  and `:0` which is the read depth.  

- Next column is sample `303` from our mapping family, its on the `fen551` plate.  Here you see we detect `4/2` and `34, 24` for haplotype 4 with 34 reads, and 2 with 24 reads. This locus is _heterozygous_.

- Next column is sample `311` from our mapping family.  Here you see we only detect haplotype `2` at `71` reads. This is _homozygous_. 

So, if we wanted to know the DNA sequence of this marker, we would look up haplotypes 4 and 2 from the `r filename("HaplotypeAllele.fasta")` file.  

One other thing to note that is very important.  the marker name, `rh_ch1_10143990` stands for rhampseq, chromosome 1, position 10143990.  This position information does not indicate the position of the polymorphism detected at this marker, it is the position of the primer sequence.  So when we map these markers, they will be very near, but not exactly at, these positions.  

## Initial analysis

- Load raw data from the [3 files](#files) previously described.

```{r load-raw, eval = FALSE}
raw <- load_data(fasta = "data/HaplotypeAllele.fasta", 
                 hap_geno = "data/hap_genotype",
                 count_mat = "data/readCountMatrixFile")
```

- Extract marker names and drop their "repeat ID", `#X`.
e.g. `rhMAS_5GT_cons95#1` -> `rhMAS_5GT_cons95`

```{r extract-markers, eval = FALSE}
marker_names <- names(raw$fasta)
marker_names_no_repeats <- lapply(marker_names, function(x) gsub("#.*", "", x))

length(marker_names_no_repeats) # 984030
length(unique(marker_names_no_repeats)) # 2055
```

- _Something that might not make sense ..._

```{r something-random, eval = FALSE}
for (loc in raw$hap_geno$Locus) {
  repeats_idx <- which(marker_names_no_repeats == loc)
  repeats <- raw$fasta[repeats_idx]
  repeats_seq <- lapply(repeats, get_seq)
  
  count_mat_idx <- which(loc == names(raw$count_mat))
  count_mat_sub <- raw$count_mat[count_mat_idx]
}
```
